# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: use of engineering principles to design, develop, test and maintain software aplications 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? software enginering has the guiding principles and steps to be followed while traditional programming was not well structured majorly focused on writing codes to solve the problem 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): is a software engineering methodology with key phases which rely on each other.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. i) Requirements gathering - documenting user needs and system requirements  ii) Design - creating the prototypes of the product to be build  iii) Implementation - writing the actual codes  iv) Testing - ensuring it meets standard and the functional requirements  v) Deployment and Maintenance - releasing the product and providing ongoing support and updates 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile - is the rapid development model utilizing incremental and iteration approach to archive flexibility while waterfall model follows defined steps one after the other consecutively upto to conclusion 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile uses iteration and incremental approach with focus on flexibility and collaboration while waterfall model use a sequential approach with distinct phases. Waterfall is condiered where the project has well defined requirements while agile is preferred where project has dynamic requirements  
Requirements Engineering: is the process of identifying, gathering, analysing and documenting the requirements 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. i) Elicitation - identifying and gathering data  ii) Analysis - analyzing the collected data iii) Documentation -recording the agreed requirements  iv) Management - updating the requiremenents through the product's lifetime 
Software Design Principles: set of guidelines and rules that determine and govern the design of a software

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity is the dividing of the system into smaller independent modules that are easily manageable. It makes it easy make changes to a module  without side effects to the whole system improving maintainability. It also component changing and independent scaling enhancing overal scalability. 
Testing in Software Engineering: process of ensuring the desired quality is achieved and the functional as well as non-functional requirements such as security are arhieved.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? i) unit - testing the individual modules ii) intergration - testing interaction between modules iii) system - testing the working of tyhe whole system  iv) acceptance - testingfor user requirements
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Version control are systems that manage and track file changes over time, they help in review and making edits. Examples are git and bitbucket
Software Project Management: process of planning, and executing software projects

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Roles of manager are but not limited to; providing ledership to the team, explaining the requirements to the stakeholders, managing the resources, ensuring timely completion, etc. Challenges include scope creep, tight deadlines, lack of resources, etc 
Software Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the product 

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?Activitie: improving perfomance - enhancing the features, fixing errors - solving problems with the product, security- enhancing security features. Importance: 
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:extends lifespan, improves efficiency, enhances security.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Privacy during data collection - solely using data for the intended purpose, Patent ownership- avoid use of other people's ideas without authorization
